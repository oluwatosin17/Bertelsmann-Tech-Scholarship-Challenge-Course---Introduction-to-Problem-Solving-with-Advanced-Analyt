Hopefully I'll be running my first model on alteryx tomorrow ðŸ¤ž

Good luck everyone.

   * Lesson 3
   * â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘ 80%
Focused on Alteryx 
   * Data Preparation
   * Data Type Conversion
   * Cleaning Data
- [I found out how to remove certain special characters with the formula tool during data cleaning](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Alteryx-Designer-Discussions/Remove-certain-special-characters/td-p/108697) 
- [If you just started learning alteryx like me you can check out](https://www.analyseup.com/learn-alteryx/alteryx-introduction.html) 

Good luck everyone. 

D5: #60daysofudacity

![Sales Report](https://github.com/oluwatosin17/Bertelsmann-Tech-Scholarship-Challenge-Course---Introduction-to-Problem-Solving-with-Advanced-Analyt/blob/main/Images/sales.png) 
    * I was able to understand how to use filter and join tools in alteryx 
    * Sorting, Aggregating and Exporting Data with Alteryx âœ…

- I probably have to go through the linear regression report again and most of lesson 3 to understand better. 

I would like to encourage @Fareedah @Paola @prenise @yonghyun @Mrleyva 

> Keep going!!! 



Good luck everyone.
