- Data types - When joining tables, the fields that you join must have the same data type, Also when performing calculations the fields must be the same. 
- Changing data types in alteryx - You can use the auto field tool to examines your data, and it  automatically optimizes the field type and length Or the select tool to manually do that.

* Cleaning up data
  * Finding extra characters in fields this could be $€£¥ symbols or numbers signs we need to remove this before changing between field types. 
  * We can remove extra characters with the replace function left function within the formula tool

- Duplicate data 
  * Using group by and count functions within the summarize tool to identify the duplicated data. 
  * We can also use the unique tool to do this. 

- I would like to encourage @ella @sara @Frida @annika @luisa

> You're great so far well done 

Good luck everyone



## D13: #60daysofudacity 22-12-2020
- Today we had a :zoom: session on browse tool #sg_discover_alteryx ! We learnt a lot about the browse tool especially profiling functionality. 
- Far more than just a window to your data, the browse tool  has a list of features to best investigate, view and copy data at any point. 
 
**Thanks for your time @Jonathan**

- [Creating an Analytical Dataset](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud977/lessons/56630bff-890b-4f55-ab05-26c65eafc4f0/concepts/3c36b7ff-a59a-4e38-a987-881ec4cc22e0) 
   * L2.17 - L2.20✅
   * Deleting Missing Data  Exercise✅
- What an analyst needs to do when faced with missing data 
  * First of all you need to identify the missing data. 
- Why we care about missing data 

[Missing data can add bias](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias to a model) 

[Read about how to deal with missing data online](https://www.mastersindatascience.org/learning/how-to-deal-with-missing-data/#:~:text=When%20dealing%20with%20data%20that,or%20factors%20may%20be%20required.) 

- It is interesting that Alteryx does not provide a tool to remove empty rows
